## Personal Website
This is the personal website of Keano Porcaro. It is hosted on the account [@slypoor](https://github.com/slypoor/) because I already had another site set up on my account for a driving instructor business. The site was moved to a DigitalOcean server and is now no longer needed on the GitHub account, however I am lazy and didn't bother transfering it over. My account now hosts another server called ransty.com, pointless at the moment as it has nothing on it. Might start blogging on it, I think I'll just let the domain expire.

# TODO:
